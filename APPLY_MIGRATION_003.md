# üö® **URGENT: Fix Paywall Issue - Missing Subscription Tables**

## **Problem**
Paid users are seeing paywalls because the `user_subscriptions` and `usage_tracking` tables are missing from the production database.

## **Solution**
Apply migration `migration-003-fix-missing-subscription-tables.sql` to add the missing tables.

## **How to Apply Migration**

### **Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your ResumeMax project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### **Step 2: Run Migration**
1. Open the file `migration-003-fix-missing-subscription-tables.sql`
2. Copy **ALL** the SQL content
3. Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"** button

### **Step 3: Verify Tables Created**
After running the migration, verify the tables exist:
```sql
-- Run this query to check if tables were created
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('user_subscriptions', 'usage_tracking')
AND table_schema = 'public';
```

You should see both tables listed.

### **Step 4: Test Paywall**
1. Have a user make a payment through Stripe
2. Check that their subscription appears in the `user_subscriptions` table
3. Verify they can now see full analysis results without paywall

## **What This Migration Does**
- ‚úÖ Creates `user_subscriptions` table to track user payment status
- ‚úÖ Creates `usage_tracking` table to monitor feature usage
- ‚úÖ Adds proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- ‚úÖ Creates indexes for performance
- ‚úÖ Adds helper functions for subscription management
- ‚úÖ Sets up triggers for automatic timestamp updates

## **After Migration**
Once applied, the paywall system will work correctly:
- **Free users**: See blurred analysis details with upgrade prompts
- **Paid users**: See full analysis details without restrictions

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**
- This migration is **safe to run** - it won't affect existing data
- The migration includes checks to prevent duplicate table errors
- Run this **immediately** to fix the paywall issue for paid users
